                Four months ago, our hearts began a journey that I will cherish forever. Though the miles between us may be long, I feel as though you're always close. We've faced challenges, we've laughed, and we've created countless memories that will last a lifetime.
            </p>
            
            <p>Every moment with you is a gift, and my love for you grows stronger with each passing day. You are my happiness, my inspiration, and my greatest blessing.</p>
                
            <p>Happy 4th Monthsary, my love. Thank you for being the most beautiful part of my life. I cannot wait for the day we can finally be together every single day.</p>

            <p>It's been <span class="highlight">120</span> days since our special day.</p>
